goatpig's LevelDB windows port

The idea behind this port is reduce dependencies on external projects to a maximum, while avoiding all unecessary source modification, 
in order to allow easy updating and seemless integration in multi-platform projects.

The msvc11 solution cannot yield WinXP compatible binaries. Instead, use the msvc9 solution.
